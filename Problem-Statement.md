In the healthcare industry, misdiagnosis endangers patient safety and impacts more than 12 million American adults every year. According to the Society to Improve Diagnosis in Medicine (SIDM), a person dies every 9 minutes due to misdiagnosis, and it is the #1 reason for malpractice suits. Although the United States has a well-developed healthcare system with accomplished physicians, its very plausible that physicians are capable of making mistakes. The top three cognitive errors that lead to misdiagnosis, also referred to Dx error, include: mistakes gathering information, mistakes in analyzing information, and premature closure. However, these issues are beyond the scope of being solved at the indivdual level. In healthcare environments, physicians are stretched beyond their capacity; there are too many patients, too many symptoms to diagnose, and too little time for them to be 100% diagnostically reliable with each and every patient.
