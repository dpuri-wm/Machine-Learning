1. When a categorical column is split into new columns with values being stored as either 0 or 1, this is called a one-hot-encoded column. The source values are discrete, because the value can only take on 2 numbers: 0 or 1. Ex: [0,1,0] refers to second class, under the class feature.

2. Dense features specify the presence and absence of data (usually by a zero). They can be useful because the model will work properly even with missing information. For example, in DATA 141, missing values were indicated as NaN. However, the model may not eba ble to interpret this string and would lose functionality.
