Below, is my image for the Jump Start Data Science T-shirt competition, and also my assignment for Project 2! I chose my content image to be a brain, since it reflects the concepts of a "neural network", which we have studied thus far in Machine Learning. The picture definitely turned out more grainy than I preferred, even when I experimented with different numbers of epochs. Still looks pretty cool though! Hope you like the picture!
