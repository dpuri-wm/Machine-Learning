## Project assignment

The goal of this project was to determine population counts of the Korle Gonno neighborhood in Accra, through specifying and estimating a model. Data consisted of 10,000 bird's eye images of the location, with each image having a size of 480 x 480 pixels. Another file contained the counts of all persons estimated to reside within the area at the time the images were taken, September 2005. An example image from the dataset is shown below:
